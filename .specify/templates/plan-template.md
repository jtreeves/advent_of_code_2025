# Technical Plan: Day {DAY_NUMBER}

## Algorithms and Data Structures

[High-level description of algorithms and data structures to be used along with an explanation of why they are optimal]

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: [O(...)]
- **Space Complexity**: [O(...)]

## Approach

[General approach for solving the problem that should be sufficient for all languages, mostly]

## Implementations
