    - [ ] Create day_{DAY_NUMBER}_spec.md with detailed specification
    - [ ] Create day_{DAY_NUMBER}_plan.md with technical plan
    - [ ] Create day_{DAY_NUMBER}_tasks.md (this file)
    - [ ] Create test data files (test_1.txt, test_2.txt, etc.)
- [ ] Implement solutions in all 12 languages
    - [ ] Write C implementation (both Part 1 and Part 2)
